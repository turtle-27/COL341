# Machine Learning Assignments
This repo contains the solutions of the assignments of the course COL341: Machine Learning offered in First (Diwali) Semester, 2021-22 at IIT Delhi.

## Assignment 1: Linear Regression
The problem statement of the assignment is present [here](A1-PS.pdf). 

In this problem, we will use Linear Regression to predict the Total Costs of a hospital patient. For training and testing, we have the SPARCS Hospital dataset. 


## Assignment 2: Logistic Regression
The problem statement of the assignment is present [here](./A2-PS.pdf). 

In this problem, we will use Logistic Regression to build a classifier for Hospital Inpatient Discharges training data. \
We build a logistic regression model for 8 class classification to predict the ’Length
of Stay’ (target column in the given dataset) of the patients in the Hospital. The length of Stay can be any of the one among {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8} days (here label 8 means ≥ 8 days). 

## Assignment 3 : Neural Networks
The problem statement of the assignment is present [here](./A3-PS.pdf).

In this problem, we will train neural networks to classify two datasets- a binary class (Toy) dataset and a multi-class (Devanagri handwritten characters) dataset.

## Assignment 4 : Convolutional Neural Networks
The problem statement of the assignment is present [here](./A4-PS.pdf).

In this assignment, we work with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and deep learning using the deep learning framework PyTorch. We perform image classification on two datasets- Devanagari handwritten characters dataset and CIFAR10 dataset.

## Assignment 5: Yoga Pose Detection
The problem statement of the assignment is present [here](./A5-PS.pdf).
